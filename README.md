This consists of the python for many models (prediction)models. 
Both regression and classification. 
Mostly random forest.

I have the code file and the input file placed in the same directory. 

So I suggest you to download the directory while reproducing the outputs, then cding (chanding directory to the one with code and input) to the run the python files. 

pull the entire directory.
